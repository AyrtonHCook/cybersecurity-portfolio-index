# Cybersecurity Portfolio Index

This repository contains three defensive security projects that demonstrate practical development across network, SIEM, and host visibility domains. Each lab focuses on a different part of the defender workflow and builds toward a complete visibility triad for incident detection and investigation.

## Projects

- **[Network Security Monitoring (Zeek and Suricata)](https://github.com/AyrtonHCook/Network-Security-Monitoring)**  
  Offline PCAP assessment using Zeek and Suricata to correlate DNS, LDAP, and HTTP telemetry with IDS alerts.

- **[Cloud Security Monitoring (Microsoft Sentinel)](https://github.com/AyrtonHCook/Microsoft-Sentinel)**  
  SIEM onboarding and detection validation using the Azure Monitor Agent, Data Collection Rules, and analytics testing.

- **[Windows Memory Forensics (Volatility 3)](https://github.com/AyrtonHCook/Volatility-3-project)**  
  Memory dump analysis recovering an encoded PowerShell command and reconstructing the execution context.

Each project includes:
- A reproducible lab environment
- Technical workflow and tooling
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- Evidence artefacts and screenshots
- Skills learned and next steps for improvement

## How This Portfolio Fits Together

The labs progress from:
1. Observing network-level behaviour  
2. Detecting malicious activity through SIEM analytics  
3. Recovering post-execution artefacts in memory  

This layered structure demonstrates capability across host, network, and cloud monitoring which aligns with core blue-team responsibilities in SOC and DFIR roles.
